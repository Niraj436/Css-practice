     <div>
        <p>
        Given the chance to revamp a page on Metalogic website, I opted for the Career page due to its abundance of card layouts. I aimed to utilize CSS grid and flex to manipulate these layouts, as these techniques offer powerful styling capabilities. Grid excels in handling larger pages with its flexibility, while flex is ideal for smaller card layouts. Additionally, the page boasted numerous icons, which I aimed to integrate seamlessly into the design.
